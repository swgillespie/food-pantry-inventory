### CS 4400 Final Project - Food Pantry Inventory System
This repository contains the code for Chris Gordon, Melaena Roberts, and Sean Gillespie's final
project for CS 4400 at Georgia Tech. This webapp is powered by Flask.

### Running this webapp
To run this webapp,
```
git clone https://github.com/swgillespie/food-pantry-inventory.git
cd food-pantry-inventory
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
This application expects an environment variable called FLASK_SECRET_KEY that is used to sign sessions.
A key can be generated by this python expression:
```python
import random
key = ''.join([random.SystemRandom().choice('abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ0123456789') for x in range(50)])
```
Then, in your favorite shell or virtualenv,
```
export FLASK_SECRET_KEY=<the key you just generated>
```

Once everything is set up,
```
python run.py
```
will start a webserver on port 5000.
